## About Me

I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at <a href="cims.nyu.edu">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href="nyu.edu">New York University</a>. I am being advised by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~wies/">Thomas Wies</a>.

I am broadly interested in formal methods and verification, and I am currently working on generalizing separation logic to verify real world concurrent search structures. 

Previously I received a bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science from <a href="cmi.ac.in">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>.
